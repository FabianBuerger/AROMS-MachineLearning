# AROMS-MachineLearning
Automatic Representation Optimization and Model Selection Framework for Machine Learning - AROMS-Framework

This is the publication of the software to the AROMS-Framework which is the main contribution of my PhD project at the university of Duisburg-Essen (Intelligent Systems Group) in Germany. 

The Matlab framework will be published as soon as the thesis will be published.
